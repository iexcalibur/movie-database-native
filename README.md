1. Set up your React Native project:
- Install Node.js and React Native CLI on your system.
- Create a new React Native project using the react-native init command.

2. Install required dependencies:
- Install necessary dependencies like Axios for making API requests and any additional libraries you may need for UI components or navigation.

3. Obtain an API key from OMDb:
- Sign up for an API key from the OMDb API website (http://www.omdbapi.com/).
- Keep your API key handy as you'll need it to make requests to the OMDb API.

4. Design the UI:
- Design a search bar component where users can enter the movie title they want to search for.
- Create a movie card component that will display the details of each movie.
- Consider using popular UI libraries like React Native Elements or React Native Paper to style your components easily.

5. Implement search functionality:
- In your search bar component, capture the user's input and store it in a state variable.
- On submitting the search query, make an API request to the OMDb API using Axios or any other HTTP library.
- Pass your API key and the user's input as query parameters in the API request.
- Retrieve the response from the API and handle the data returned.

6. Display search results:
- Once you receive the response from the API, parse the data and extract the relevant movie information (e.g., title, poster, plot, etc.).
- Render the movie card components dynamically based on the search results.
- Display the movie information on each card, such as the movie title, poster image, and any other relevant details.

7. Implement individual movie cards:
- Make each movie card component clickable or touchable to navigate to a detailed view of the movie.
- Pass the necessary movie information to the detailed view component as props.
- Design the detailed view component to display more extensive information about the movie, such as the full plot, cast, ratings, etc.

8. Add navigation:
- Implement a navigation system, such as React Navigation, to navigate between the search results and the detailed view of the movie.
- Set up appropriate navigation routes and screens for search results and the detailed movie view.

9. Test and refine:
- Test your application by performing various searches, ensuring that the movie cards display the correct information and the detailed view shows the complete movie details.
- Make any necessary adjustments to the UI or functionality based on user testing or feedback.

10. Deployment:
- Once you're satisfied with your application, you can build and deploy it to the desired platforms (iOS, Android) using the appropriate commands and tools.
